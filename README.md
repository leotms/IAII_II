# Feedforward Neural Network using Backpropagation.

Implementation of a feedforward Neural Network using backpropagation for solving pattern classification problems.

## Requirements:
  - Python 3.x
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas

## Running:

  ```bash
  $ python excercise2.py
  ```
  Will perform all networks (2 to 10 neurons) for all datasets.

  ```bash
  $ python excercise2_bestset.py
  ```
  Will perform all networks (2 to 10 neurons) for only for the best dataset.

  ```bash
  $ python excercise3_p1.py
  ```
  Will run prediction for binary classification. As in Excercise 3 Part 1.

  ```bash
  $ python excercise3_p2.py
  ```
  Will run prediction for multiclass classification. As in Excercise 3 Part 2.

## Other:

  - Graphics and results are stored in `results/` folder.
  - A complete description of this proyect can be found in the `docs` folder.
